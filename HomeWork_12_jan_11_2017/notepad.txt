 1) what are the data types in java script?

 JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values.
 JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. 


Java script can handle different types of datatypes:
String	    represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
Number	    represents numeric values e.g. 100
Boolean	    represents boolean value either false or true
Undefined	represents undefined value
Null	    represents null i.e. no value at all
Object      represents instance through which we can access   members
Array	    represents group of similar values

We need to use "var" here to specify the data type. 

Example:
********
var a=40;     //holding number  
var b="Divya";//holding string 
var=keyword
a=name of the variable and then initialization by a value

 2) what are the diff between java and javascript espically in terms of variables? 

 To Declare a variable in javascript we need to declare it with a keyword called "var" as shown in the above example,unlike in java or c++ we literally declare the datatype using the datatype name as shown below
 In Java:
 ********
 int a = 10;
 String b="Divya";

 3) why do we use javascript in web pages?
 Javascript is all over the web ,as it programs the the behavior of web pages.
 Javascript is a client-side scripting language.
 Javascript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.
 for example:responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms,games.

 4) how to include javascript into webpages? where to include java script in webpages and why?
 They are few different ways of adding javascript into a webpage
 1.By the <script> tag in head or body
 example:
 ********
 <head>
 <script>
 //By default script language of website is javascript 
 </script>
 </head>

                    or

  <body>
 <script>
 //By default script language of website is javascript 
 </script>
 </body>

 It is always a good practise to put our javascript at the bottom of the body tag ,therefore the rest of the page can load first before the javascript executes.

 2.By linking a .js file in the head or body.
 In seperate folder Create a new file  and name it with .js extension and write some script in that file.
 Now  link that .js file in your index.html using script tag as shown below
 <script src="scripts/main.js">
 </script> 

 3.Inline

 	It is done by using  "onclick"
 	onclick="alert('hi');"
