What are Media Queries?
Media queries allow us to crete CSS rules based on various parameters(viewport size,device type etc)
We can arrange our layout to suit a wide variety of different device/screen sizes

For example we can create a media query which targets just  mobile screen sizes

"Responsive Design" is the strategy of making a site that "responds" to the browser and device that it is being shown on... by looking awesome no matter what.

Media queries are the most powerful tool for doing this. 

Syntax:
@media<media-type> and(expressions){}

Example
@media TV and(min-width:1200px){}
@media screen and(max-width:800px){}

min-width/max-width:
The ‘width’ media feature describes the width of the targeted display area of the output device.

@media (max-width:450px){
	background:red;
}
@media (min-width:451px)and (max-width:450px){
	background:blue;
	}
