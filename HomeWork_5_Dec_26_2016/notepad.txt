1) explain all input types with examples
The HTML <input> tag is used within a form to declare an input element - a control that allows the user to input data.
	The keyword used to define a form is "Form"
	we are creating simplest input form type
	Inputs can be several different types 

	1.text input--If we want to give the Text input to a webpage.
example:
    <input type="text"/>
	<input type="text" value="email"/>
	<input type="text" placrholder="type here.."/>

	2.email input   --To give email as a input 
example:
    <input type="email" placrholder="type here.."/>

	3.textarea --To type large areas of text
example:
    <textarea>write a comment</textarea>

	4.Submit button--Submit button is used to submit an application
example:
	<input type="submit" value="Click Me!">

	5.Check box --To make a selection from Multiple options
example:
	<input type="checkbox" />Dog
	<input type="checkbox" />Cat
	<input type="checkbox" />Fish

	6.Radio button--To select between two options
example:
    <input type="radio" name="color"/>Red
	<input type="radio" name="color"/>Green
While using radio button if we use "name" we can switch between two options 

    7.Drop Down Box--This is one kind of input types.which is created using "Select" keyword
example:
    <select>
	<option> Select an Option..</option>
	<option>1</option>
	<option>2</option>
	<option>3</option>
	</select>
	
2) explain all the input attributes?

 HTML tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information.

An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts: a name and a value:
Attribute names and attribute values are case-insensitive.

Core Attributes:
****************
id
title
class
style

id Attribute:
*************
The id attribute  can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page. 
-Two elements can't have the same id name.
If we have two elements of the same name within a Web page  we can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements.

example:
*******
<h1 id="html">This para explains what is HTML</p>
<h1 id="css">This para explains what is Cascading Style Sheet</p>
title Attribute:
*****************
The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. They syntax for the title attribute is similar as explained for id attribute.

example:
********
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>The title Attribute Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3 title="Hello HTML!">Titled Heading Tag Example</h3>
</body>
</html>


The class Attribute:
********************
The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class of element.

example:
*******
class="className1 className2 className3"

The style Attribute:
********************
The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>The style Attribute</title>
</head>
<body>
<p style="font-family:arial; color:#FF0000;">Some text...</p>
</body>
</html>

what are semantic elements ?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
 Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

  Difference  between article, section, div?
  Section:
The section tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.

Article:
The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

div:
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <div> tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.

Differences between html4 and html5?
HTML5 has several goals which differentiate it from HTML4.
1.Better Web Application Features.
2.Improved Element Semantics
